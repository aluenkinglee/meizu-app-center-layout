mz-app-center-layout
====================
This project demonstrates how to make full use of actionbar + Tab + ViewPager in order to implement meizu app center's main layout, which include a custom layout with 3 tabs at actionbar,and 3 viewpages.

====================
NOTICE:
\n1.This demo only works great with Meizu's cell phones running Flyme2.0+ because a Meizu API is reflected in it.
\n2.The ViewPager's adapter extended PagerAdapter. For more information,see http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/view/PagerAdapter.html
